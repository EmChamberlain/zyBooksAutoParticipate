# zyBooksAutoParticipate
Automatically Participates in zyBooks Assignments.

This is pretty rough around the edges and anyone that wants to smooth it out is welcome to branch.


## Usage:  
python main.py -h   
Make sure to check afterwards and finish the ones that his program misses. It currently does not even attempt to do fill in the blanks
or participation activities (the ones where you just have to type anything in).


## Disclaimer:  
This is for purely educational purposes and I do not condone using this. Use at your own risk  
If you dont have python3 installed you have two options:  
1. Install python3 from [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)  
2. Hope to god that a release made with [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) works. [Link](https://github.com/MattChamberlain/zyBooksAutoParticipate/releases)
